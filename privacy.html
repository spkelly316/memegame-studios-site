                <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>We retain information only for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

                <h2>8. International Visitors</h2>
                <p>If you access the Site from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be processed and stored in countries that may have different data protection laws than your country of residence. By using the Site, you consent to the transfer of information to the United States and other locations where our service providers may be located.</p>
                <p>If we later adopt specific compliance steps for certain regions (such as GDPR in the EU or UK, or CCPA/CPRA in California), we may update this Privacy Policy to reflect those changes.</p>
